# pt

A command line tool that have various sub commands which help me manage my
personal photo archive:
 - `copy`: copies photos and videos to a directory with a
   `%Y/%m/$DEVICE/$ALBUM/%Y%m%d-%H%M%S%3N.$EXTENSION` (example:
   `2012/01/my-phone/Holiday/20120130-160001001.JPG`).
 - `cr2dupe`: deletes a Canon Raw file if a duplicate JPEG also exists.
 - `scan`: scans all photos and videos within a directory and adds their file
   hash to a database.

`pt` is a bespoke tool which most likely wont be of much use to anyone except
myself.
